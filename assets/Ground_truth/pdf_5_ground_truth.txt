 WASHINGTON (AFP) — The US government watchdog on religious freedom abroadcriticized India for refusing to grant its representatives visas, after their planned trip came underfire from Hindu conservatives.

 India joins only Cuba in refusing a visit by the US commission, which has been allowed to 
visit even nations whose records it frequently criticizes such as China and Saudi Arabia.

 A delegation of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) had 
planned to leave on June 12 for India, where it has voiced concern about a rise in communalviolence.
