1. Background 
This 
report 
summarises 
the 
documentation 
and 
findings 
of 
the 
peer 
review 
of 
the 
trigger 
used 
in 
UN 
OCHA’s 
Burkina 
Faso 
Anticipatory 
Action 
framework 
for 
drought. 
The 
impact 
prediction 
model 
used 
as 
a 
basis 
for 
this 
trigger 
was 
developed 
by 
the 
OCHA 
Centre 
for 
Humanitarian 
Data 
Predictive 
Analytics 
team. 
The 
go-no-go 
trigger 
mechanism 
is 
based 
on 
the 
IRI 
seasonal 
rainfall 
forecast, 
with 
a 
threshold 
dependent 
on 
geographical 
coverage 
and 
below-average 
rainfall 
probability. 
To 
find 
out 
more, 
please 
see 
the 
Anticipatory 
Action 
Framework 
for 
Burkina 
Faso. 


The 
review 
has 
been 
conducted 
between 
May 
and 
December 
2022. 


2. Main Findings and Recommendations 
You 
can 
find 
all 
the 
documentation 
regarding 
the 
model, 
its 
application 
and 
the 
review 
process 
at 
the 
following 
links: 


● 
The 
Model 
Card 
describes 
version 
1.0 
of 
the 
model 
and 
was 
completed 
in 
May 
2022. 
● 
The 
Model 
Evaluation 
Matrix 
was 
completed 
in 
July 
2022 
by 
a 
technical 
expert 
from 
the 
Red 
Cross 
Red 
Crescent 
Climate 
Centre. 
● 
The 
Implementation 
Plan 
was 
completed 
in 
October 
2022. 
It 
summarises 
the 
concrete 
actions 
that 
the 
model 
will 
trigger 
or 
inform 
as 
part 
of 
the 
2021 
OCHA 
anticipatory 
action 
framework 
in 
Burkina 
Faso. 
● 
The 
Ethical 
Matrix 
aims 
to 
identify 
all 
stakeholders 
and 
potential 
issues 
regarding 
the 
intended 
use 
of 
the 
model. 
The 
Ethical 
Matrix 
was 
completed 
by 
an 
expert 
from 
DFID 
in 
November 
2022. 
A 
summary 
of 
the 
main 
findings 
and 
recommendations 
is 
provided 
below. 


2.1 Technical Review 
Intended Use 


● 
The 
model 
is 
simple 
and 
scalable; 
however, 
an 
alternative 
source 
of 
forecast 
should 
be 
used 
for 
verification, 
and 
other 
drought 
indicators 
such 
as 
dry 
spells 
considered. 

● 
Clarification 
is 
required 
on 
the 
mismatch 
between 
drought 
return 
periods, 
and 
how 
geographical 
targeting 
is 
performed 
given 
the 
coarse 
resolution. 
Model Development and Documentation 


● 
Additional 
verification 
metrics 
are 
required 
to 
increase 
the 
confidence 
of 
the 
trigger, 
in 
particular 
due 
to 
the 
limited 
hindcast. 
● 
More 
clarity 
is 
needed 
on 
how 
the 
minimum 
required 
area 
of 
below 
average 
precipitation 
of 
10% 
was 
chosen, 
and 
the 
exact 
thresholds 
used 
across 
lead 
times 
and 
activation 
windows 
should 
be 
specified. 
Model Evaluation 


● 
The 
model 
uncertainty 
was 
clearly 
communicated 
and 
accepted 
by 
stakeholders. 
● 
A 
strategy 
to 
increase 
model 
trust 
is 
lacking. 
For 
example, 
the 
methodology 
could 
be 
submitted 
to 
a 
peer-review 
/ 
academic 
journal 
for 
review 
once 
it 
is 
more 
mature. 
● 
Discussion 
on 
potential 
negative 
risks 
due 
to 
interventions 
occurring 
in 
a 
conflict-affected 
country 
is 
very 
much 
needed. 
Operational Readiness 


● 
The 
model 
was 
developed 
collaboratively 
and 
is 
ready 
to 
be 
piloted. 
● 
The 
choice 
of 
forecasting 
information 
and 
baseline 
for 
verification 
should 
be 
re-examined 
to 
improve 
trust 
in 
the 
trigger 
system. 
● 
More 
reflection 
on 
the 
potential 
negative 
effects 
of 
a 
false 
alarm 
is 
required. 
2.2 Ethical Review 
Effectiveness: Regional Selection 


The 
motivation 
behind 
the 
selection 
of 
targeted 
regions 
is 
unclear, 
and 
in 
particular, 
is 
missing 
Est, 
which 
has 
been 
identified 
as 
high-risk 
across 
several 
factors, 
including 
food 
insecurity. 


● 
Recommendation: 
Expand 
the 
explanation 
on 
the 
selection 
of 
the 
four 
regions, 
in 
particular 
why 
Est 
was 
not 
included 
and 
Boucle 
de 
Mouhoun 
was. 
Effectiveness: Focus on Drought 


The 
cause 
of 
food 
insecurity 
in 
Burkina 
Faso 
is 
linked 
with 
several 
factors 
in 
addition 
to 
drought, 
including 
conflict, 
agricultural 
practice, 
supply 
chain 
disruptions 
and 
food 
prices. 


● 
Recommendation: 
Better 
justify 
the 
selection 
of 
rainfall 
as 
the 
sole 
trigger 
and 
why 
other 
factors 
were 
not 
included. 
Effectiveness: Sub-regional Targeting 


It 
is 
unclear 
if 
and 
how 
sub-districts 
with 
projected 
IPC-5 
will 
be 
targeted. 


● 
Recommendation: 
Include 
more 
details 
on 
how 
districts 
and 
communities 
most 
in 
need 
will 
be 
targeted 
by 
the 
UN 
agencies 
implementing 
the 
interventions. 

Efficiency and Feasibility: Best Use of Resources 


With 
the 
Burkina 
Faso 
HRP 
being 
severely 
underfunded, 
it 
is 
unclear 
whether 
this 
anticipatory 
action 
pilot 
diverts 
funding 
away 
from 
more 
urgent 
needs 
identified 
by 
the 
Food 
Security 
Cluster. 


● 
Recommendation: 
Discuss 
the 
potential 
impacts 
that 
$15 
million 
could 
have 
on 
the 
region 
or 
globally 
and 
compare 
to 
the 
impacts 
of 
the 
no-regrets 
approach. 
Efficiency and Feasibility: Maximise Collective Action and Avoid Duplication 


The 
rationale 
for 
the 
choice 
of 
model, 
and 
how 
it 
helps 
leverage 
common 
resources 
and 
avoid 
duplication, 
is 
lacking. 


● 
Recommendation: 
Expand 
the 
framework 
to 
discuss 
how 
the 
model 
complements 
existing 
early 
warning 
and 
food 
insecurity 
mitigation 
efforts 
in 
Burkina 
Faso, 
such 
as 
FEWS 
NET 
and 
CH/IPC. 
Efficiency and feasibility: Risk/harm-benefit Analysis 


A 
risk/harm-benefit 
analysis 
is 
required 
to 
understand 
ethical 
and 
financial 
risks 
and 
is 
missing 
from 
the 
framework. 


● 
Recommendation: 
Perform 
a 
full 
risk/harm-benefit 
analysis. 
Accountability and Community Participation 


The 
implementation 
plan 
makes 
little 
reference 
to 
affected 
communities, 
local 
organizations 
and 
authorities 
in 
the 
design 
of 
the 
framework. 


● 
Recommendation: 
The 
framework 
should 
include 
activities 
to 
engage 
and 
explain 
the 
model 
to 
local 
civil 
society, 
affected 
populations 
and 
authorities. 
● 
Recommendation: 
Explain 
why 
there 
were 
no 
partnerships 
formed 
with 
ECOWAS, 
UEMOA 
and 
the 
RCPA. 
Neutrality, Impartiality and Conflict-sensitivity 


It 
is 
unclear 
how 
much 
the 
framework 
takes 
into 
account 
the 
presence 
of 
conflict 
in 
the 
region. 


● 
Recommendation: 
Investigate 
the 
feasibility 
of 
carrying 
out 
a 
detailed 
conflict 
sensitivity 
assessment. 
Trustworthiness and Reliability 


Outstanding 
questions 
remain 
on 
choice 
of 
forecast, 
and 
whether 
other 
options 
were 
considered. 


● 
Recommendation: 
Expand 
the 
explanation 
of 
why 
the 
IRI 
dataset 
was 
the 
only 
one 
used. 
Transparency and Explainability 


No 
information 
on 
how 
an 
external 
actor 
can 
learn 
how 
the 
model 
works 
and 
understand 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
trigger 
decisions. 


● 
Recommendation: 
Amend 
the 
framework 
to 
include 
activities 
that 
engage 
and 
explain 
the 
model 
to 
local 
civil 
society, 
affected 
populations 
and 
authorities. 

Human in the Loop 


No 
human 
stop 
mechanism 
specified 
per 
the 
recommendation 
of 
the 
Ethiopia 
evaluation. 


● 
Recommendation: 
Investigate 
the 
possibility 
of 
including 
a 
stop 
mechanism.
