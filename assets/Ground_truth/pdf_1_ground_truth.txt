Somalia 
Flood 
Exposure 
Methodology 
Note 


Analysis 
for 
2024 
HNRP 


This 
technical 
note 
summarises 
the 
methodology 
used 
to 
calculate 
the 
number 
of 
people 
potentially 
exposed 
to 
flooding 
in 
Somalia 
in 
the 
2024 
Somalia 
Humanitarian 
Needs 
and 
Response 
Plan 
(HNRP). 
The 
UN 
OCHA 
Centre 
for 
Humanitarian 
Data 
worked 
with 
a 
wide 
range 
of 
technical 
partners 
to 
develop 
a 
methodology 
that 
was 
then 
endorsed 
by 
the 
Somalia 
ICCG 
and 
HCT. 


Daily 
FloodScan 
(1998-2022) 
& 
WorldPop 
(2020 
UN 
Adjusted) 
raster 
data 
was 
analysed 
to 
gain 
understanding 
of 
flood 
conditions 
across 
Somalia 
for 
both 
March-April-May 
(MAM) 
and 
October-November-December 
(OND) 
seasons. 
FloodScan 
daily 
flood 
fraction 
Standard 
Flood 
Exposure 
Depiction 
(SFED) 
was 
aggregated 
to 
yearly 
seasonal 
maximum 
fraction 
composites 
for 
both 
the 
MAM 
and 
OND 
seasons 
for 
all 
years 
of 
historical 
FloodScan 
data 
(1998-2022). 


The 
yearly 
seasonal 
SFED 
composites 
were 
then 
processed/reclassified 
in 
two 
distinct 
ways: 


1. 
Composites 
reclassified 
to 
binary 
using 
a 
20 
percent 
flood 
fraction 
threshold. 
2. 
Composites 
masked 
to 
just 
remove 
any 
flood 
fraction 
values 
< 
0.05 
percent 
and 
the 
flood 
fraction 
(0-100 
percent) 
retained. 
All 
composites 
in 
both 
sets 
of 
processed 
yearly-seasonal 
flood 
fraction 
rasters 
were 
then 
multiplied 
by 
the 
WorldPop 
(2020 
UN 
Adjusted) 
population 
estimate 
raster 
to 
create 
two 
sets 
of 
yearly 
seasonal 
flood 
exposure 
rasters. 
These 
were 
then 
aggregated 
at 
the 
second 
administrative 
level 
via 
zonal 
statistics 
(sum) 
to 
obtain 
the 
estimated 
population 
exposure 
per 
district 
for 
each 
season 
across 
all 
years 
for 
each 
set. 
These 
estimates 
were 
converted 
to 
the 
percent 
of 
population 
exposed 
by 
dividing 
the 
estimates 
by 
the 
total 
population 
per 
district 
(from 
World 
Pop 
raster). 
The 
percent 
exposure 
figure 
was 
then 
applied 
to 
the 
updated 
2024 
population 
data 
set 
(UN 
OCHA, 
UNFPA 
Methodology) 
to 
obtain 
updated 
population 
exposure 
estimates. 
These 
data 
were 
further 
aggregated 
to 
administrative 
level 
1. 


Ranges 
for 
exposure 
were 
estimated 
using 
percentiles 
for 
both 
the 
MAM 
and 
OND 
seasons 
per 
administrative 
level. 
As 
ECMWF 
seasonal 
forecast 
predicts 
an 
above 
average 
precipitation 
season 
for 
MAM 
2024, 
the 
range 
of 
population 
exposed 
was 
based 
on 
the 
50th-95th 
percentile 
levels. 
Since 
there 
was 
no 
available 
data 
to 
inform 
predictions 
for 
OND 
2024, 
the 
25-75th 
percentile 
values 
were 
used 
to 
bound 
the 
range. 
The 
lower 
and 
upper 
limits 
of 
the 
ranges 
were

calculated 
at 
the 
administrative 
level 
using 
all 
of 
the 
historical 
yearly 
seasonal 
flood 
exposure 
estimates. 
The 
two 
sets 
of 
range 
estimates 
were 
combined 
conservatively 
by 
taking 
the 
maximum 
value 
for 
both 
the 
upper 
and 
lower 
bounds 
for 
each 
season.
